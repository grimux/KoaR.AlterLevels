# KoaR.AlterLevels
A quick and dirty tool to update your zone levels in Kingdoms of Amalur

Usage is very simple pass in filename path and the desired level.

The program will set all the zones in your save to have this level that it can decipher, so now you can walk around the world and set it to something crazy like this:

Note that the only safe levels are between 0 and 45. If you set the zone level to 45 the game becomes VERY hard, but this might be the only way to get some of the loot that normally cannot spawn like the level 45 Gentleman's favor.

### Thanks

@Twlightsh - who has been my sounding board and helped me do the lua injection and nonsense neccessary to understand the game format.
